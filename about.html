                                    Chicago's northside  neighborhoods  an environment in which to learn  and play  hockey.  To be  a

                                    neighborhood. MDHL is ran by  a  small fulltime staff,  and relies on  the generous volunteer  time  of 
                                    parents and previous league  members.</p>
